# Electrode-Design for Digital Microfluidics with open-source CAD software, OpenScad

As you may know, there are many commercial software for modeling (more professional word, CAD (computer-aided design)), like SOLIDWORKS and CATIA. However, I started to design my electrode for digital microfluidics applications using programming in OpenScad. The shape of electrodes plays a key role in the motion of droplets, and in this work, I designated numbers of equilateral triangular with different gaps( 5 um to 40 um) with a loop. I put the code in Jupyter Notebook, but you should copy it in the software environment to run.
